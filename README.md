# Sample state machine with TypeScript
# OOP, TDD
# Unit tests with JEST
The main purpose of this repository to learn and try out TypeScript capabilities. 
In this example, I implemented a generic State Machine.
You can use this generic state machine in your individual or commercial projects. Or only you can investigate to get some kind of idea. 
State machines are everywhere in our life. Coffee machine, kitchen Owens, traffic lights and many.
You can learn more about on the https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html

# Little technical details
In this example especially it tried to you write code with object-oriented and TDD way. 
I used some kind patters like builder, factory, state and I used enum and interfaces, generics etc ...
The most important thing you can write Unit tests on this code with Jest test framework. 
I tried to keep it simple. But briefly, I understood TypeScript is an awesome programming language which built on JavaScript.
You can use it in your big projects with trust. It keeps your code clean, easy maintainable and testable.
